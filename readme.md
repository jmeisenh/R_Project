# Findind Suitible Markets for Services and Products for the Elderly  

*This slightly morbid project focuses on finding countries with higher life expectancies to sell products marketed to the elderly*

## How do we do this  

The world health organization collects data on various metrics from vaccination rates, expenditure on healthcare, BMI, etc.. from year to year.  
Can we use this data to target elderly products and services to various demographics?  

For example, We want to find countries with high average life expectancy so we can maximize profit over time and have a larger market. Coutnries with low spending per person on healthcare can be targeted for selling medical insurance. Less educated countires can be targeted for adult education courses. Countires with high average BMI can be targeted for plus size clothing. Balancing all of these parameters against average life expectancy can be a difficult process, but data can help.

## Where's the beef?
